PonyFlash
=========

# About
PonyFlash is a random flash animation viewer similar to "I WANT MOAR", but with a better client. (In fact, it pulls its swfs from I WANT MOAR.)

I've decided to rewrite it using React and Node instead of plain JS and PHP like it is now, because I hate both React and Node but don't want to knock it before I try it.
